# TaskBoard — Project Management App

A Next.js 15 fullstack application for managing projects, tasks, and team members. TypeScript + Prisma + PostgreSQL on the server, React 19 + TanStack Query on the client.

## Quick Setup (Docker — Recommended)

```bash
# Clone and enter the repo
git clone <repo-url> && cd taskboard

# Start the app and database
docker-compose up --build

# In a separate terminal, set up the database
docker-compose exec web npm run db:seed

# Run the test suite
docker-compose exec web npm test

# The app is now running at http://localhost:3000
```

## Manual Setup (without Docker)

Requires: Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL 15+

```bash
# Run the setup script (installs deps, sets up DB, configures git hooks)
chmod +x bin/setup
./bin/setup

# Or do it manually:
npm install
git config core.hooksPath .git-hooks
cp .env.example .env   # then edit DATABASE_URL if your local Postgres differs
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
npm run db:seed
npm test
npm run dev
```

## AI Tool Conversation Tracking

**This repository is configured to automatically capture your AI coding tool conversation history with each git commit.** This includes conversations from Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Continue.dev, Cody, Cline, and Windsurf.

This is part of the Ajackus evaluation process. We evaluate how you collaborate with AI tools — your prompting strategy, how you break down problems, and how you review AI suggestions. The captured conversations help us understand your workflow.

**How it works:**
- A pre-commit git hook runs automatically before each commit
- It copies conversation files from AI tool directories (e.g., `.claude/`, `.cursor/`) into `.ai-conversations/`
- These files are staged and included in your commit
- You don't need to do anything — it happens automatically

**What's captured:** Only AI tool conversation logs stored in the project directory. No system files, browsing history, or anything outside this repository.

**If you prefer a tool that doesn't store local conversations** (like browser-based ChatGPT), the screen recording will capture your interactions instead. No additional action needed from you.

## Seed Data

The seed file creates:
- 5 users across 3 projects with different roles (admin / member / viewer)
- 3 projects with realistic task distributions
- 12 tasks spanning all four statuses (`todo`, `in_progress`, `review`, `done`)

All user passwords are: `password123`

| Email | Role on which project |
|-------|----------------------|
| meera@taskboard.dev | admin on Q3 Launch & Internal Tools, member on Onboarding |
| arjun@taskboard.dev | admin on Onboarding, member on Q3 Launch |
| kavya@example.com | member on Q3 Launch |
| dev@example.com | viewer on Q3 Launch |
| lina@example.com | member on Onboarding |

## Authentication

Register or login to get a JWT token:

```bash
# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"meera@taskboard.dev","password":"password123"}'

# Use the returned token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3000/api/projects
```
